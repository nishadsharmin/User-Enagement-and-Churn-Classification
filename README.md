# User-Enagement-and-Churn-Classification
Classification model to identify engaged users and unengaged users for Churn Reduction

1. Define a target metric to measure user engagement. How would you define an engaged  vs. unengaged user? 

2. Please provide the business justification and associated visualisations / rationale  in choosing your definition of engagement  

3. Using your logic from above, build a model (heuristic/statistical/ML) to classify engaged and unengaged users  

4. Assuming an unengaged user is a churned user, now suppose we use your model to identify unengaged users and implement 
   some business actions try to convert them to  engaged users (commonly known as reducing churn)  

  a. How would you set up a test/experiment to check whether we are actually  reducing churn?  
  b. What metrics and techniques would you use to assess the impact of the business  action?
